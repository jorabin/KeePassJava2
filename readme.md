        <version>2.0.0</version>

## Java Version

It is written for Java 1.7.

## Quick Start

The class Javadoc on Interface classes Database, Group and Entry describe
how to use the methods of those classes to create and modifty entries.

### Load KDBX Database

        // get an input stream
        InputStream inputStream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("test123.kdbx");
        // password credentials
        Credentials credentials = new KdbxCredentials.Password("123".getBytes());
        // open database
        Database database = DomDatabaseWrapper.load(credentials, inputStream);

        // visit all groups and entries and list them to console
        database.visit(new Vistor.Print());

### Save KDBX Database
        // create an empty database
        DomDatabaseWrapper database = new DomDatabaseWrapper();

        // add some groups and entries
        for (Integer g = 0; g < 5; g++){
            Group group = database.getRootGroup().addGroup(database.newGroup(g.toString()));
            for (int e = 0; e <= g; e++) {
                // entry factory is a local helper to populate an entry
                group.addEntry(entryFactory(database, g.toString(), e));
            }
        }

        // save to a file with password "123"
        FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("test.kdbx");
        database.save(new KdbxCredentials.Password("123".getBytes()), outputStream);


### Load KDB Database

        InputStream inputStream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("test.kdb");
        // password credentials
        Credentials credentials = new KdbCredentials.Password("123".getBytes());
        // load KdbDatabase
        Database database = KdbDatabase.load(credentials, inputStream);

        // visit all groups and entries and list them to console
        database.visit(new Vistor.Print());


## Dependencies

Aside from the JRE the API depends on

- Google Guava [license](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/COPYING).
- Spongy Castle which is a repackaging for Android of Bouncy Castle [license](https://www.bouncycastle.org/licence.html)

It also depends on SLF4J and Junit for tests.

## Build

Maven 3.
