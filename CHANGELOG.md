##[2.0.0] 2016-08-31

Starting at release 2.0.0 Since this is keepassjava2. Don't ask what happened to keepassjava1.

- Has readonly implementation for Keepass 1.x compatible files
- Has a DOM based implementation for Keepass 2.x KDBX files - being a DOM based implementation it's slow but means that saved entries are untouched by the program even if it doesn't understand them.
